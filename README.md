## What is UserBundleExtended?

UserBundleExtended is not a plugin for [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle). It's an application that only will
demonstrate how you can use FOSUserBundle-Method's and configuration. I have change many
things for my needed privacy project for user and security. But many things is, what you
search for on stackoverflow, too.

Now you can install this application for your sandbox. Play with it and you can see what
you get, if you change configuration or methods.

I hope this application can answer your questions about FOSUB.

[Checkout the video for visual demonstration at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogyof5WTp3c&feature=youtu.be)

## I have integrate the follow functions:

- Avatar-Support
- Locale-Support
- Subuser-Support
- Admin-Support for management all users of the application
- Admin-Support with switch user
- Small Dashboard to demonstrate how i can cache rss-feed.
- Enquiry-Form with file upload and without database-entity. The entity is only for validations

- Technical from FOSUB: Change forms, add event-listener, overwrite action-methods

- and many other things.
